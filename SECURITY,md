## Supported Versions

We currently support only the main branch. The FIPS branch cannot be updated, because doing
so will cause the code to be out od sync with the code that was certified.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability:

Under the repository name, click Security. If you cannot see the "Security" tab,
select the dropdown menu, and then click Security. Click Report a Vulnerability to open the
advisory form. Fill out the form and then Submit the report.

Someone from the team will contact you ASAP about the issue.
