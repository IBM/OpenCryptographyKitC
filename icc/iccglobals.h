/*! @brief
  These are the error codes returned from ICC API calls where the return type allows an error to be returned.
  - Note that where a function returns a pointer, ICC will return NULL if an ICC API error occurs.
  - Note the difference between ICC_OSSL_FAILURE and ICC_OSSL_FAILURE_TOO.
  - ICC_OSSL_FAILURE on a verify operation means that the verify failed.
  - ICC_OSSL_FALURE_TOO means that something prevented the verification being done - RNG wasn't initialized for example
  - ICC_FAILURE can occur if ICC wasn't initialized correctly or a FIPS self test error occurred and the API is locked.
  - ICC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED added for ICCPKG. With two ICC's under the hood, some functions may be missing

  Value IDs used by SetValue/GetValue 
  - Note that the following values are unusable in production code.
  The memory callbacks can only set once per process, first to call wins, 
  and in integrated products the ICC users simply cannot guarantee that 
  they can win the races to set these as there may be multiple independently
  written users of ICC within one process space.
  - FIPS: The memory callbacks are permitted in FIPS mode provided there's only 
    a single user of ICC in the process space.
  - Reason: 
    - The process memory allocators can be hooked in other ways
    - The memory is in the same process, there are easier ways to obtain keys than by
      hooking the memory callbacks.
    - i.e. there's no reduction in security allowing these callbacks in FIPS mode.
  - <b>ICC_MEMORY_ALLOC</b>
  - <b>ICC_MEMORY_REALLOC</b>
  - <b>ICC_MEMORY_FREE</b>
  - The following values may be set, but since ICC 1.2.1, ICC will return ICC_WARNING indicating
  that they were already set. (Internally by ICC on startup to OS thread model defaults). Same problem
  as with the memory callbacks, but to ensure proper operation in threaded code
  they had to be set, and no individual application could guarantee they'd be the
  one to set them with multiple ICC users in the same process.
