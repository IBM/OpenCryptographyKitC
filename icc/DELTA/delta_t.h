  you must have cycled. That's not done internally as the latency needed

  @note This isn't particularly accurate and it shouldn't be used
  in intermediate calculations. i.e. use count values in any statistics and
  use the conversion here to normalize results to real time at the end of the
  process.
  - Also note, this is extremely expensive in CPU time, 
  it may appear to hang for quite a while depending on arch
  - on the other hand, you don't HAVE to call this routine
