  Data structures to allow us to cope with the NIST chained data inputs
  without excessive alloc/copy/free work
  This API only tracks blocks of data, it never creates/destroys them
  or takes copies.
  This structure is limited length, simply because the aim
  isn't to have a general purpose routine, just something that'll track
  pre-allocated data and provide a consistant API so the code is less ugly
