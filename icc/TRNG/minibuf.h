/*! @brief
    Small buffer structure to improve performance and 
    reduce lock contention throughout the RBG code.
    Size is fixed to 64 bytes. 
    @note Generally the buffer is used at  quite a low level, 
    and later compression/mixing reduces any
    impacts from these buffers being in memory.
    - In general, less than 64 bytes of RBG OUTPUT data would
    be exposed by residual information.
    - The data in these buffers is usually mixed with data from 
    other sources before compression.
    - The buffer is deliberately small to reduce the risks to long
    lived keys.
