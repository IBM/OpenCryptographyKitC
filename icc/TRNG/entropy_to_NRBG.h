  @brief
  - This routine implements the TRNG code, but is actually layered on 
    top of multiple low level 'TRNG' routines which provide entropy
  - Enforces the entropy guarantee made by the underlying sources
  - Performs the NIST Adaptive Proportion and Repeat Count tests
    This code is used by all the TRNG's which are accessible by applications.
  - the gb() callback provides raw entropic bits from the 'TRNG's
  @param T  Pointer to a TRNG, structure to hold TRNG data
  @param data buffer for returned value
  @param len length of returned value
  @note FIPS 140-3 TRNG entropy estimator is called here
  \FIPS VE07.13.01 Resistance of the seed generator (TRNG)
  - Initial state:
    The initial internal  state of the TRNG is determined by the function 
    efPersonalize() which incorporates date/time, machine ID, 
    process ID/Thread ID and high resolution timing data. 
    This only guarantees uniqueness.
  - Internal state:
    The current internal state of the TRNG is used to initialize a buffer into
    which samples from the raw entropy source are mixed before a primary 
    distribution check is carried out.
    Data from the entropy source (which passed the primary distribution test) 
    is mixed back into this internal state buffer.
  - Entropy guarantee
    - Short term, the entropy sources coming into here have passed the NIST
      entropy estimation tests. The Adaptive prediction tests, the Repitition
      Count test, and have an entropy estimate (PMAX) >= to the entropy
      guarantee.
    - Long term A compression function is used to estimate the entropy 
      in the TRNG, if that falls below the design minimum the TRNG shuts down. 
      In the event that's the global TRNG hooked into OpenSSL, ICC shuts down.
