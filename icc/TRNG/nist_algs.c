  @note These tests operate by comparing the points at which assessed
  entropy changes when compared with a reference version. The reference

  check accuracy. On Linux:

  This is test code so we can see the numbers coming up sane.

  Note, we can never have a bucket with <8 samples come up as the most frequent value.
  We have 128 samples spread across 16 buckets and <8 samples in one bucket means
  there has to be at least 1 more sample somewhere else.

  Uniformly distributed would have 8 samples/bucket (max entropy)
  very poorly distributed would have all 128 samples in one bucket
  The odds of a perfect distribution are really poor but it can happen
  so we have 5 entropy values (e)
  4 = e = 100% 
  3 = 75% <= e < 100%
  2 = 50% <= e < 75%
  1 = 25% <= e < 50%
  0 = 0%  <= e < 25%


  The original code had a bug and missed the 100% case.
